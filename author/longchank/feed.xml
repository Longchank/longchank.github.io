      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/gainomax">&lt;p&gt;With my work at NORM I noticed that we did not have a way to display single products in 3D, not in a store but in a survey question or similiar. So I decided to build a quick way to display products in our surveys. This had to be light weight and device agnostic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found Three.js to be the best option for this.
So I made the below viewer, it was quite easy to get started and building a simple viewer in Three.js.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Three.js and 3D for web matures I see that this can be enhanced with alot more features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gainomax shake is just a test product that I created using Photogrammetry.
I wanted to see if photogrammetry could be a method for creating 3D products instead of modeling them from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/the-ring">&lt;h1 id=&quot;its-time-to-grow-up&quot;&gt;It´s time to grow up!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-i-made-this-engagement-ring-in-blender&quot;&gt;So I made this engagement ring in Blender.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea was to 3D print it, since this was my first encounter in designing jewelery I started by reading on various design techniques in jewelry. There was plenty of material to go through and I felt comfortable in creating a ring that would be “the” ring for my lady.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used Blender and a plugin i found when researching jewelry design. It´s called JewelCraft, the plugin helped me very much with scale, adding prongs, adding rocks that followed a specific curve. It also gave me an estimation on the weight of the ring in various materials, which in turn gave me an estimation in cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/ring/Side.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; title=&quot; &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also great since I already have started with a design, using curves. And the plugin uses curves for placing and creating various elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue I had was how to find and fit the stones, how the fitting of the large stone should look and what was actually possible to create that wont break or will be to loose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/ring/side2.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; title=&quot; &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By a happenstance the Stockholm startup Ve and Vile had a presentation during one of our startup community breakfasts.
I contacted them, and they helped me with some design questions and finding the rocks for me. They also was the ones that 3D printed it for me and fitted the rocks. So all i had to do was to make the ring the best ring ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/ring/Top.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; title=&quot; &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just to be cool, I made the box as well. Walnut with leather/cotton pillows.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
