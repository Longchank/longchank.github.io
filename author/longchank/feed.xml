&lt;p&gt;With my work at NORM I noticed that we did not have a way to display single products in 3D, not in a store but in a survey question or similiar. So I decided to build a quick way to display products in our surveys. This had to be light weight and device agnostic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found Three.js to be the best option for this.
So I made the below viewer, it was quite easy to get started and building a simple viewer in Three.js.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Three.js and 3D for web matures I see that this can be enhanced with alot more features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gainomax shake is just a test product that I created using Photogrammetry.
I wanted to see if photogrammetry could be a method for creating 3D products instead of modeling them from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;gooey&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;dot&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;dots&quot;&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/the-ring">&lt;h1 id=&quot;its-time-to-grow-up&quot;&gt;It´s time to grow up!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-i-made-this-engagement-ring-in-blender&quot;&gt;So I made this engagement ring in Blender.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea was to 3D print it, since this was my first encounter in designing jewelery I started by reading on various design techniques in jewelry. There was plenty of material to go through and I felt comfortable in creating a ring that would be “the” ring for my lady.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used Blender and a plugin i found when researching jewelry design. It´s called JewelCraft, the plugin helped me very much with scale, adding prongs, adding rocks that followed a specific curve. It also gave me an estimation on the weight of the ring in various materials, which in turn gave me an estimation in cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/ring/Side.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; title=&quot; &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also great since I already have started with a design, using curves. And the plugin uses curves for placing and creating various elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue I had was how to find and fit the stones, how the fitting of the large stone should look and what was actually possible to create that wont break or will be to loose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/ring/side2.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; title=&quot; &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By a happenstance the Stockholm startup Ve and Vile had a presentation during one of our startup community breakfasts.
I contacted them, and they helped me with some design questions and finding the rocks for me. They also was the ones that 3D printed it for me and fitted the rocks. So all i had to do was to make the ring the best ring ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/ring/Top.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; title=&quot; &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just to be cool, I made the box as well. Walnut with leather/cotton pillows.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <link href="http://localhost:4000/professor-murphys-cube" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Professor Murphy's Wooden Puzzle" />
      <published>2017-07-27T12:00:00+02:00</published>
      <updated>2017-07-27T12:00:00+02:00</updated>

      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/professor-murphys-cube">&lt;p&gt;An AR step-by-step guide for a puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been wanting to see how a step by step guide would look and feel like in AR. So using the puzzle i had at home i created this AR guide for how to solve it.
Since I have been working alot in Playmaker, a visual scripting tool for Unity. I did this fully in Playmaker, with only little code to connect ARFoundation with Playmaker.
Below are some screenshots from the different statemachines i used to control the app. I used a controller for the context of the app then for each step of the puzzle i made a template statemachine that would be generic for each step. The generic template controls the text and the value of the step, so I could understand which step was the first and last step. Because on the first step and last step different tweens would happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The controller.
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/murphy/controller.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; title=&quot; Controller for the app &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The template that is on each piece of the puzzle
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/murphy/piece_template.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; title=&quot; Statemachine for each piece &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;graphics&quot;&gt;Graphics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the graphics I created UI sprites and built a world canvas that would be the way the user interacts with the steps.
This was built with AR in mind, but due to the small size of the puzzle and the way the user would interact with the puzzle in real life it was not advantageous to use such a canvas. Therefore i added also the ability to swipe between each step, removing the obstacle of trying to tap a small world space button.
The text though worked, but with a screen-space canvas the text would have given more clarity to each step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the 3D models i created them just by measuring each wooden block so it could be scale 1:1 in the app. Then I created a custom shader in Amplify Shader Editor, in which I could control both the color and alpha inside each step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/murphy/blockshader.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; title=&quot; Simple shader &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
